**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The kathbee.nz website is built on the Wix Thunderbolt platform, which renders all content dynamically via JavaScript. The static HTML contains no readable text -- all content is loaded client-side from Wix's data models. As a result, verbatim extraction of every word was not possible through standard web fetching. The content below has been reconstructed from multiple authoritative sources including Google search index cache snippets, third-party sites hosting Kath Bee's biography (muzic.nz, beautifulthings.nz, ncma.nz, bandcamp.com, kidsrhythmandrock.com, nowtolove.co.nz), and the search engine's own cached text excerpts from each page. Every effort has been made to capture the exact wording used on the site.
